# Text-to-Audio-Generator-with-Diffusers
This project showcases generative audio AI. You provide a text prompt describing a sound or piece of music, and the app uses the Music Gen model via the Hugging Face Diffusers library to generate a corresponding audio clip.
# üé∂ AI Text-to-Audio Generator

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://your-streamlit-app-url.streamlit.app/) Turn your words into sound! This app uses generative AI to create audio clips from simple text descriptions. Whether you want to hear "a cinematic orchestral piece with a sense of adventure" or "the sound of rain falling on a tin roof," this tool brings your imagination to life.

It's a fun playground for musicians, sound designers, or anyone curious about the future of AI-powered creativity.

## üöÄ How to Run It Locally

Let's get you making some noise! Follow these steps to run the app locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/text_to_audio.git](https://github.com/your-username/text_to_audio.git)
    cd text_to_audio
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Heads up: The first time you run the app, it will download the AudioLDM 2 model from Hugging Face. It's a fairly large download, so please be patient!*

4.  **Launch the app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

The app will open in your web browser. Start typing and see what sounds you can create!
